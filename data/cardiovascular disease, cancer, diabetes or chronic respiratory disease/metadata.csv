Short description,"Probability (%) of dying between age 30 and exact age 70 from any of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory diseases (SDG indicator 3.4.1)"
Definition,"The percentage of 30-year-old people who would die before their 70th birthday from any of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory disease, assuming that they would experience current mortality rates at every age and they would not die from any other cause of death (e.g., injuries or HIV/AIDS)."

Process of validation,WHO conducts a formal country consultation process before releasing its cause-of-death estimates. The number of deaths were country consulted with country designated focal points (usually at the Ministry of Health or National Statistics Office) as part of the full set of causes of death prior to the release.
Rationale,"Disease burden from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) among adults - the most economically productive age span - is rapidly increasing in developing countries due to ageing and health transitions. Measuring the risk of dying from target NCDs is important to assess the extent of burden from mortality due NCDs in a population. This indicator has been selected to measure NCD mortality for the ""25 by 25"" NCD mortality target"
Denominator,"Cause of death estimates have large uncertainty ranges for some causes and some regions. Data gaps and limitations in high-mortality regions reinforce the need for caution when interpreting global comparative cause of death assessments, as well as the need for increased investment in population health measurement systems. The use of verbal autopsy methods in sample registration systems, demographic surveillance systems and household surveys provides some information on causes of death in populations without well-functioning death registration systems, but there remain considerable challenges in the validation and interpretation of such data, and in the assessment of uncertainty associated with diagnoses of underlying cause of death."
Institutional mandate,"According to Article 64 of its constitution, WHO is mandated to request each Member State to provide statistics on mortality. Furthermore, the WHO Nomenclature Regulations of 1967 affirms the importance of compiling and publishing statistics of mortality and morbidity in comparable form. Member States started to report mortality data to WHO since the early fifties and this reporting activity is continuing until today."
Preferred data sources,The preferred data source is death registration systems with complete coverage and medical certification of cause of death.
Other data sources,"household surveys with verbal autopsy, and sample or sentinel registration systems."
