SDG Goal,3.2.2– Neonatal mortality rate
Short description,Number of deaths during the first 28 completed days of life per 1000 live births in a given year or other period.
Definition,"The number of deaths during the first 28 completed days of life per 1000 live births in a given year or other period. Neonatal deaths (deaths among live births during the first 28 completed days of life) may be subdivided into early neonatal deaths, occurring during the first 7 days of life, and late neonatal deaths, occurring after the 7th day but before the 28th completed day of life."
Direction of progress,"Figures decreasing over time demonstrates progress.
Generally, the proportion of neonatal deaths among child deaths under the age of five is expected to increase as countries continue to witness a decline in child mortality."

Method of estimation aggregates,Global and regional estimates of neonatal mortality rates are derived using the aggregated number of country-specific neonatal deaths for a specific region or globally estimated by the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) using a birth-week cohort approach and aggregated country-specific births from the United Nations Population Division.
Process of validation,"The United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) conducts an annual country consultation whereby the draft UN IGME estimates, empirical data used to derive the estimates, and notes on methodology are sent to National Statistical Offices and to Ministries of Health or other relevant agencies for review. National Statistical Offices, Ministries of Health or other relevant agencies have the opportunity to provide feedback or comments on estimates and methods, as well as supply additional empirical data during this consultation."
Rationale,"Mortality rates among young children are a key output indicator for child health and well-being, and, more broadly, for social and economic development. It is a closely watched public health indicator because it reflects the access of children and communities to basic health interventions such as vaccination, medical treatment of infectious diseases and adequate nutrition."
Denominator,"The reliance on multiple data sources, i.e. surveys and census conducted several years apart and producing retrospective time series, can result in disparate mortality rates from different sources, sometimes referring to the same time period. Available data also suffer from sampling and nonsampling errors, including misreporting of age and sex, survivor selection bias, underreporting of child deaths, and recall errors as data are collected retrospectively. Further misclassifications can also impact the accuracy of data, for example, early neonatal deaths may be classified as stillbirths. Thus, simply comparing two country data points from different sources and drawing a line between them is not a technically sound way to assess levels and trends. Given varying levels of data quality across different sources, this sort of trend assessment will provide misleading results. Hence, the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) fits a statistical model to these data that takes into account these various data sources to produce annualized estimates.
It is important to keep these challenges in mind when looking at available country data and also when discrepancies between country data and the UN IGME estimates are being discussed. The followingpoints are important to highlight:
• The UN IGME aims to minimize the errors for each estimate, harmonize trends over time and produce up-to-date and properly assessed estimates of child mortality. Thus, UN IGME estimates are derived from country data. Notably, UN IGME assesses the quality of underlying data sources and adjusts data when necessary.
• National estimates may refer to an earlier calendar year than the UN IGME estimates. This is particularly the case where estimates from the most recent national survey are used as the national estimate, since the survey estimates derived from a birth history are retrospective and typically refer to a period before the year of the survey, which may be several years behind the target year for the UN IGME estimates. National estimates may also use a different combination of data sources, or different projection or calculation methods.
• In the absence of error-free data, there will always be uncertainty around data and estimates. To allow for added comparability, the UN IGME generates estimates with uncertainty bounds. When discussing the UN IGME estimates, it’s important to look at the uncertainty ranges, which might be fairly wide in the case of some countries."
Institutional mandate,"The United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME), led by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and including members from the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank Group and the United Nations Population Division, was established in 2004 to advance the work on monitoring progress towards the achievement of child survival goals and to augment country capacity to collect high quality data on and produce timely estimates of child mortality. Every year, the UN IGME estimates levels and trends in neonatal mortality at the global, regional and country level and provides an assessment of current progress towards the SDG targets."
Data collection process,"For neonatal mortality, UNICEF and the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) compile data from all available data sources, including household surveys, censuses, and vital registration data. UNICEF and the UN IGME compile these data whenever they are available publicly and then conduct data quality assessment. UNICEF also collects data through UNICEF country offices by reaching national counterpart(s). The UN IGME also collects vital registration data reported by Ministries of Health or other relevant agencies to WHO.
Nationally representative estimates of child mortality can be derived from several different sources, including civil registration and sample surveys. Demographic surveillance sites and hospital data are excluded as they are not nationally representative. The preferred source of data is a civil registration system that records births and deaths on a continuous basis. If registration is complete and the system functions efficiently, the resulting estimates will be accurate and timely. However, many countries do not have well-functioning vital registration systems. In such cases household surveys, such as the UNICEF-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the USAID-supported Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and periodic population censuses have become the primary sources of data on under-five and neonatal mortality. These surveys ask women about the survival of their children, and it is these reports that provide the basis of child mortality estimates for a majority of low- and middle-income countries. These data are subject to sampling and non-sampling errors, which might be substantial."
Preferred data sources,"Civil registration is the preferred data source for under-five, infant and neonatal mortality estimation. Neonatal mortality rates are calculated using the number of neonatal deaths and the number of live births over a period. For civil registration data, initially annual observations were constructed for all observation years in a country."
Other data sources,"Population census and household survey data: The majority of survey data comes from the full birth history (FBH), whereby women are asked for the date of birth of each of their children, whether the child is still alive, and if not the age at death."
Expected frequency of data collection,The United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) underlying database is continuously updated whenever new empirical data become available.
Data providers,The National Statistical Office or the Ministry of Health is the typical provider of data for generating neonatal mortality estimates at the national level.
