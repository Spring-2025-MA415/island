Method of measurement,"Service/facility reporting system (""administrative data""): Reports of vaccinations performed by service providers (e.g. district health centres, vaccination teams, physicians) are used for estimates based on service/facility records. The estimate of immunization coverage is derived by dividing the total number of vaccinations given by the number of children in the target population, often based on census projections. Household surveys: Survey items correspond to children’s history in coverage surveys. The principle types of surveys are the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) 30-cluster survey, the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), and the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The indicator is estimated as the percentage of children ages 12–23 months who received three doses of the combined diphtheria, tetanus toxoid and pertussis vaccine time before the survey."
Method of estimation aggregates,Global and regional coverage is a weighted sum of WHO/UNICEF estimates of national coverage by target population from the United Nations Population Division's World Population Prospects. The size of the target population is the national annual number of infants surviving their first year of life.
Process of validation,"WHO and UNICEF encourage countries to review and comment on the draft coverage estimates shared following the draft production. In past years, regional or sub-regional consultations have been held during May/June to go through select country data and estimates."
Rationale,Immunization is an essential component for reducing under-five mortality. Immunization coverage estimates are used to monitor coverage of immunization services and to guide disease eradication and elimination efforts. It is a good indicator of health system performance.

Comments,"The quality of the estimates are determined by the quality and availability of empirical data. Vaccination is relatively easy to measure and two methods - facility reports and surveys - have been developed, each of which, when properly designed and implemented, provides accurate and reliable direct measures of coverage levels. Implemented jointly , they provide a validation of coverage levels. However, both methods are subject to biases. In some instances, these biases may be identified and corrected and we have attempted to do so. These data are supplemented with local consultations that often explain inconsistencies and anomalies in the data and provide insight into forces that influence coverage levels. WHO and UNICEF are working closely with countries to improve the quality and usefulness of coverage monitoring data systems."
Data collection process,"Annual data collection through established mechanism. Since 1998, in an effort to strengthen collaboration and minimize the reporting burden, WHO and UNICEF jointly collect information through a standard questionnaire (the Joint Reporting Form) sent to all Member States"
