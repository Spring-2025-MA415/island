Method of estimation aggregates,"Country estimates of number of deaths by cause, along with corresponding population estimates, are summed to obtain regional and global aggregates."
Process of validation,The number of deaths were country consulted with country designated focal points (usually at the Ministry of Health or National Statistics Office) as part of the full set of causes of death prior to the release.
Rationale,"The measure of mortality rate from unintentional poisonings provides an indication of the extent of inadequate management of hazardous chemicals and pollution, and of the effectiveness of a country’s health system."
Denominator,"Data on deaths are widely available from countries from death registration data or sample registration systems, which are feasible systems, but good quality data are not yet available in all countries. Such data are crucial for improving health and reducing preventable deaths in countries. For countries that do not have such registration systems, data need to be completed with other types of information."
Institutional mandate,"According to Article 64 of its constitution, WHO is mandated to request each Member State to provide statistics on mortality. Furthermore, the WHO Nomenclature Regulations of 1967 affirms the importance of compiling and publishing statistics of mortality and morbidity in comparable form. Member States started to report mortality data to WHO since the early fifties and this reporting activity is continuing until today."
Comments,"High-income countries have systems in place for collecting information on causes of death in the population. Many low- and middle-income countries do not have such systems, and the numbers of deaths from specific causes have to be estimated from incomplete data. Improvements in producing high quality cause-of-death data are crucial for improving health and reducing preventable deaths in these countries. Please refer to the Global Health Estimates methods document for more details, including confidence intervals for comparisons of age-specific rates across countries or time."
Data collection process,"WHO collects data directly from country sources, and following established method, estimates are shared with countries to receive their feedback before publication. See Indicator 6.1 for more details."
Preferred data sources,"Data inputs to the estimate include (a) data on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene services and practices, and (b) cause-of-death data, of which the preferred data source is death registration systems with complete coverage and medical certification of cause of death."
Other data sources,"Other possible data sources include household surveys with verbal autopsy, sample or sentinel registration systems, special studies and surveillance systems."
Expected frequency of data collection,WHO sends an e-mail twice annually requesting tabulated death registration data (including all causes of death) from Member States. Countries may submit annual cause-of-death statistics to WHO on an ongoing basis.
Data providers,"National statistics offices, various line ministries and databases covering civil registration with complete coverage and medical certification of cause of death."
