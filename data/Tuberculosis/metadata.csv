Method of estimation aggregates,"Estimates are also produced at global level, for WHO regions and for World Bank Income Groups. For methodology, see Annex 1 of the WHO global tuberculosis control report"
Process of validation,"Estimates of TB burden are prepared in July-August and shared with countries for review. In selected countries with new survey data, estimates are updated separately during the year. All estimates are communicated in August-September and revisions are made based on feedback. The final set of estimates is reviewed in WHO before publication in October, for compliance with specific international standards and harmonization of breakdowns for age and sex groups."
Rationale,"Incidence (cases arising in a given time period, usually one year) gives an indication of the burden of TB in a population, and of the size of the task faced by a national TB control programme. Incidence can change as the result of changes in transmission (the rate at which people become infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis), or changes in the rate at which people infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis develop TB disease (e.g. as a result of changes in nutritional status or of HIV infection). Because TB can develop in people who became infected many years previously, the effect of TB control on incidence is less rapid than the effect on prevalence or mortality. Target 6.c of the Millenium development Goals is to ""have halted by 2015 and begun to reverse the incidence of malaria and other major diseases"". Indicator 6.9 is defined as ""incidence, prevalence and death rates associated with TB""."
Institutional mandate,Several World Health Organization resolutions endorsed by Member States at different World Health Assemblies have given the World Health Organization responsibility for monitoring the burden of TB globally and reporting on the response.
Associated resolutions,"WHA 67.11
                                                WHA 62.15
                                                WHA 58.14
                                                WHA 60.19
                                                WHA 44.8
                                                WHA 53.1"
Comments,"TB incidence has been used for over a century as a main indicator of TB burden, along with TB mortality. The indicator allows comparisons over time and between countries. Improvement in the quality of TB surveillance data result in reduced uncertainty about indicator values.
Routine surveillance data provide a good basis for estimates of incidence in countries where the majority of incident cases are treated and notified to WHO. Where the proportion of cases notified is consistent over time (even if it is low), trends in incidence can be judged from trends in notified cases. Where TB control efforts change over time it is difficult to differentiate between changes in incidence and changes in the proportion of cases notified. A national surveillance system is an integral part of good TB control, and one of the components of DOTS, which forms the core of the Stop TB Strategy. As surveillance improves in countries implementing the strategy, so will estimates of the incidence of TB."
Data collection process,"National Tuberculosis (TB) Programmes report their annual TB data to WHO every year between April and June using a standardized web-based data reporting system maintained at WHO. The system includes real-time checks for data consistency. Estimates of TB burden are prepared in July-August and shared with countries for review in August-September; revisions are made based on feedback received. In selected countries with new survey data, estimates are updated separately during the year. The final set of estimates is reviewed in WHO before publication in October, for compliance with specific international standards and harmonization of breakdowns for age and sex groups."
