Method of measurement,"The percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods is also referred to as the proportion of demand satisfied by modern methods. The components of the indicator are contraceptive prevalence (any method and modern methods) and unmet need for family planning. Contraceptive prevalence is the percentage of women who are currently using, or whose partner is currently using, at least one method of contraception, regardless of the method used. For analytical purposes, contraceptive methods are often classified as either modern or traditional. Modern methods of contraception include female and male sterilization, the intra-uterine device (IUD), the implant, injectables, oral contraceptive pills, male and female condoms, vaginal barrier methods (including the diaphragm, cervical cap and spermicidal foam, jelly, cream and sponge), lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), emergency contraception and other modern methods not reported separately (e.g., the contraceptive patch or vaginal ring). Traditional methods of contraception include rhythm (e.g., fertility awareness-based methods, periodic abstinence), withdrawal and other traditional methods not reported separately."
Numerator,"The numerator is the number of women of reproductive age (15-49 years old) who are currently using, or whose partner is currently using, at least one modern contraceptive method (CPMod)."
Denominator,The denominator is the total demand for family planning (the sum of the number of women using any contraceptive method (CPAny) and the number of women with unmet need for family planning (UMN)).
Method of estimation aggregates,"The Bayesian hierarchical model is used to generate regional and global estimates and projections of the indicator. Aggregate estimates and projections are weighted averages of the model-based country estimates, using the number of women aged 15-49 for the reference year in each country. The number of women aged 15-49 are taken from United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2022). World Population Prospects 2022. Numbers of women who are married or in a union are taken from United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2022). Estimates and Projections of Women of Reproductive Age Who Are Married or in a Union: 2022 Revision. New York: United Nations, which are estimates and projections based on data from United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2019). World Marriage Data 2019."
Process of validation,"For surveys with microdata sets, the indicators are calculated following the definitions and concepts described above. These results are compared with the indicators published in survey reports, SDG national reporting platforms, or obtained from ad hoc queries. In some cases of discrepancies, the results are consulted with the national institutions that conducted the survey.
For model-based estimates and projections, out-of-sample validation methods are described in Kantorová et al (2020)."
Rationale,"The proportion of demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods is useful in assessing overall levels of coverage for family planning programmes and services. Access to and use of an effective means to prevent pregnancy helps enable women and their partners to exercise their rights to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to have the information, education and means to do so. Meeting demand for family planning with modern methods also contributes to maternal and child health by preventing unintended pregnancies and closely spaced pregnancies, which are at higher risk for poor obstetrical outcomes. Levels of demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods of 75 per cent or more are generally considered high, and values of 50 per cent or less are generally considered as very low."
Denominator,"Differences in the survey design and implementation, as well as differences in the way survey questionnaires are formulated and administered can affect the comparability of the data. The most common differences relate to the range of contraceptive methods included and the characteristics (age, sex, marital or union status) of the persons for whom contraceptive prevalence is estimated (base population). The time frame used to assess contraceptive prevalence can also vary. In most surveys there is no definition of what is meant by “currently using” a method of contraception.
In some surveys, the lack of probing questions, asked to ensure that the respondent understands the meaning of the different contraceptive methods, can result in an underestimation of contraceptive prevalence, in particular for traditional methods. Sampling variability can also be an issue, especially when contraceptive prevalence is measured for a specific subgroup (by age-group, level of educational attainment, place of residence, etc.) or when analysing trends over time."
Comments,"Looking at the highest values of the indicator, in 22 countries representing regions such as Europe and Northern America, Latin America and the Caribbean and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, more than 85 percent of women who want to avoid pregnancy are using a modern contraceptive method but for no country is this estimate above 91 percent.
Even in these countries, specific sub-populations (for example, adolescents or the poor) can still face barriers of access to family planning information and services. It should also be recognized that reaching 100 percent may not be a necessary or even desirable outcome with respect to reproductive rights. Some women may prefer to use a traditional method, even while having access to a full range of modern methods and being aware of the typical differences in effectiveness of methods in preventing pregnancies. Other women might have ambivalent preferences regarding their next pregnancy which may influence their contraceptive choice.
When data on women aged 15 to 49 are not available, information for married or in-union women is reported. Illustrations of base populations that are sometimes presented are: married or in-union women aged 15-44, sexually active women (irrespective of marital status), or ever-married women. Notes in the data set indicate any differences between the data presented and the standard definitions of contraceptive prevalence or unmet need for family planning or where data pertain to populations that are not representative of women of reproductive age."
Notes,The indicator has no global numerical ‘target’ value set to be achieved by 2030.
Data collection process,"Data are compiled based on systematic searches of websites of international survey programmes, survey databases (e.g., the Integrated Household Survey Network (IHSN) database), websites of national statistical offices, SDG national reporting platforms and ad hoc queries in addition to utilization of the country-specific information from UNFPA country offices."
Preferred data sources,"This indicator is calculated from nationally-representative household survey data. Multi-country survey programmes that include relevant data for this indicator are: Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys (CPS), Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Fertility and Family Surveys (FFS), Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020 surveys (PMA), World Fertility Surveys (WFS), other international survey programmes and national surveys. For information on the source of each estimate, see United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2022). World Contraceptive Use 2022. (https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/data/world-contraceptive-use)"
Expected frequency of data collection,Data are compiled in the period from October to April.
Data providers,"Survey data are obtained from national household surveys that are internationally coordinated—such as the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), the Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS), and the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), Gender and Generation Surveys (GGS)—and other nationally-sponsored surveys."
Data compilers,"This indicator is produced at the global level by the Population Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, United Nations in collaboration with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)."
