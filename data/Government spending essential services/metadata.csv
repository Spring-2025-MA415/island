Process of validation,"The UNESCO Institute for Statistics shares all indicator values and notes on methodology with National Statistical Offices, Ministries of Education, or other relevant agencies in individual countries for their review, feedback and validation before the publication of the data."
Rationale,The share of domestic general government health expenditures of general government expenditure indicates the priority of the government to spend on health from own domestic public resources. It expresses this priority by comparing the size of current public health expenditures relative to the total size of government expenditure.
