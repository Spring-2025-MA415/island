Also known as,SDG indicator 3.5.2
SDG Goal,3.5.2 – Alcohol
Short description,"Total amount of alcohol consumed per adult (15+ years) over a calendar year, in litres of pure alcohol.
(SDG 3.5.2)"
Definition,"The total alcohol consumption per capita (APC) is defined as the total (sum of three-year average recorded and three-year average unrecorded APC, adjusted for three-year average tourist consumption) amount of alcohol consumed per adult (15+ years) over a calendar year, in litres of pure alcohol.
Recorded alcohol consumption refers to official statistics (production, import, export, and sales or taxation data), while the unrecorded alcohol consumption refers to alcohol which is not taxed and is outside the usual system of governmental control. Tourist consumption takes into account tourists visiting the country and inhabitants visiting other countries. Positive figures denote alcohol consumption of outbound tourists being greater than alcohol consumption by inbound tourists, negative numbers the opposite. Tourist consumption is based on UN tourist statistics."

Method of measurement,"Recorded alcohol consumption refers to alcohol consumed according to the official statistics at country level based on production, import, export, and sales or taxation data. When government national statistics are not available, country-specific alcohol industry statistics in the public domain based on interviews or fieldwork are used; otherwise, data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations' statistical database (FAOSTAT) are used, or data from alcohol industry statistics in the public domain based on desk review. Unrecorded alcohol consumption refers to alcohol which is not taxed and is outside the usual system of governmental control, such as home or informally produced alcohol (legal or illegal), smuggled alcohol, surrogate alcohol (which is alcohol not intended for human consumption), or alcohol obtained through cross-border shopping (which is recorded in a different jurisdiction). When nationally representative empirical data (which are often general population surveys in countries where alcohol is legal) are not available, specific other empirical investigations, or expert opinion supported by periodic surveys of experts at country level using modified Delphi-technique, are used. The litres of alcohol consumed by tourists (15 years of age or older) in a country are based on the number of tourists who visited a country, the average amount of time they spent in the country, and how much these people drink on average in their countries of origin (estimated based on per capita consumption of recorded and unrecorded alcohol). Furthermore, tourist alcohol consumption also accounts for the inhabitants of a country consuming alcohol while visiting other countries (based on the average time spent outside of their country (for all people 15 years or older) and the amount of alcohol consumed in their country of origin). These estimations assumes the following: (1) that people drink the same amounts of alcohol when they are tourists as they do in their home countries, and (2) that global tourist consumption is equal to 0 (and thus tourist consumption can be either net negative or positive).Tourist consumption is based on UN statistics, and data are provided by IHME."
Numerator,"The sum of the amount of recorded alcohol consumed per capita (15+ years), average during three calendar years, in litres of pure alcohol, and the amount of three-year average unrecorded alcohol per capita consumption (15+ years), during a calendar year, in litres of pure alcohol, adjusted for tourist consumption."
Denominator,"Midyear resident population (15+ years) for the same calendar year, UN World Population Prospects, medium variant."
Denominator source,UN World Population Prospects
Method of estimation aggregates,Regional and global aggregates are population weighted averages from country values (weighted by population of inhabitants 15+ years of the respective countries).
Process of validation,Estimates are sent to focal points or national counterparts in the country through WHO Regional Offices for validation and endorsement.
Rationale,"Alcohol consumption can have an impact not only on the incidence of diseases, injuries and other health conditions, but also on the course of disorders and their outcomes in individuals. Alcohol consumption has been identified as a component cause for more than 200 diseases, injuries and other health conditions. Per capita alcohol consumption is widely accepted as the best possible indicator of alcohol exposure in populations and the key indicator for estimation of alcohol-attributable disease burden and alcohol-attributable deaths. Its correct interpretation requires the use of additional population-based indicators such as prevalence of drinking, and, as a result, stimulates development of national monitoring systems on alcohol and health involving contributions from a wide range of stakeholders, including alcohol production and trade sectors."
Denominator,"The indicator is feasible and suitable for monitoring purposes as evidenced by availability of data from 190 countries and inclusion of this indicator in global, regional and national monitoring frameworks. This is the key indicator for alcohol exposure in populations. The data available (based on production, import, export, and sales or taxation) do not enable the disaggregation of alcohol per capita consumption (APC) by sex or age; to this end, other data sources, such as survey data, are needed. The estimation of unrecorded APC remains a challenge, and triangulation of data from different sources as well as Delphi-techniques are used for increasing validity of estimates. In recent time, the number of research activities focused on improvement of the estimates of unrecorded alcohol consumption as well as their geographical coverage have increased substantially. As a result, it leads to a more accurate assessment of the total amount of alcohol consumed per person per year in a given country."
Institutional mandate,"Monitoring public health risks and generate, collate, compile and disseminate reliable information on the health impact of alcohol, drugs and addictive behaviours as well as health policy and health system responses."
Data collection process,"The Global Survey on Alcohol and Health is conducted periodically in collaboration with all six WHO regional offices. National counterparts or focal points in all WHO Member States are officially nominated by the respective ministries of health. They are provided with the online survey data collection tool for completion. Where online completion is not feasible, a hard copy of the tool is forwarded to those who requested it. The survey submissions are checked and whenever information is incomplete or in need of clarification, the questionnaire is returned to the focal point or national counterpart in the country concerned for revision. Amendments to the survey responses are resubmitted by e-mail or electronically. Data submitted from countries is triangulated with data from key industry-supported data providers at annual meetings organized by WHO with an objective to identify discrepancies and solutions. Estimates for key indicators, such as APC, are compiled into country profiles which are sent to the focal point or national counterpart in the country for validation and endorsement."
Preferred data sources,"Recorded: Government statistics or, alternatively, alcohol industry statistics in the public domain, FAOSTAT.
Unrecorded: Nationally representative empirical data or, alternatively, specific empirical investigations, expert opinion.
Tourist: UN tourist statistics"
