SDG Goal,3.2.1 – Under–five mortality rate
Short description,"Probability of a child born in a specific year or period dying before reaching the age of five, if subject to age-specific mortality rates of that period.
(SDG 3.2.1)"
Definition,"The probability of a child born in a specific year or period dying before reaching the age of five, if subject to age-specific mortality rates of that period.
Under-five mortality rate as defined here is strictly speaking not a rate (i.e. the number of deaths divided by the number of population at risk during a certain period of time) but a probability of death derived from a life table and expressed as rate per 1000 live births."

Method of measurement,"For countries with adequate trend of data from civil registration, the calculations of under-five and infant mortality rates are derived from a standard period abridged life table."
Method of estimation aggregates,"Global and regional estimates are derived from numbers of estimated deaths and population for age groups 0 year and 1-4 year, aggregated by relevant region."
Process of validation,"The United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) conducts an annual country consultation whereby the draft UN IGME estimates, empirical data used to derive the estimates, and notes on methodology are sent to National Statistical Offices and to Ministries of Health or other relevant agencies for review. National Statistical Offices, Ministries of Health or other relevant agencies have the opportunity to provide feedback or comments on estimates and methods, as well as supply additional empirical data during this consultation."
Rationale,"Under-five mortality rate measures child survival. It also reflects the social, economic and environmental conditions in which children (and others in society) live, including their health care. Because data on the incidences and prevalence of diseases (morbidity data) frequently are unavailable, mortality rates are often used to identify vulnerable populations."
Denominator,"A civil registration system that continuously records all births and deaths in a population is the preferred source of high-quality underlying data on under-five mortality but these systems are not well developed in many low- and middle-income countries. Instead, household surveys and population censuses are the primary sources of underlying data in these countries."
Institutional mandate,"The United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME), led by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and including members from the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank Group and the United Nations Population Division, was established in 2004 to advance the work on monitoring progress towards the achievement of child survival goals and to augment country capacity to collect high quality data on and produce timely estimates of child mortality. Every year, the UN IGME estimates levels and trends in under-5 mortality at the global, regional and country level and provides an assessment of current progress towards the SDG targets."
Comments,"The reliance on multiple data sources, i.e. surveys and census conducted several years apart and producing retrospective time series, can result in disparate mortality rates from different sources, sometimes referring to the same time period. Available data also suffer from sampling and nonsampling errors, including misreporting of age and sex, survivor selection bias, underreporting of child deaths, and recall errors as data are collected retrospectively. Further misclassifications can also impact the accuracy of data, for example early neonatal deaths may be classified as stillbirths. Thus, simply comparing two country data points from different sources and drawing a line between them is not a technically sound way to assess levels and trends. Given varying levels of data quality across different sources, this sort of trend assessment will provide misleading results. Hence, the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) fits a statistical model to these data that takes into account these various data sources to produce annualized estimates.
It is important to keep these challenges in mind when looking at available country data and also when discrepancies between country data and the UN IGME estimates are being discussed. The followingpoints are important to highlight:
- The UN IGME aims to minimize the errors for each estimate, harmonize trends over time and produce up-to-date and properly assessed estimates of child mortality. Thus, UN IGME estimates are derived from country data. Notably, UN IGME assesses the quality of underlying data sources and adjusts data when necessary.
 - National estimates may refer to an earlier calendar year than the UN IGME estimates. This is particularly the case where estimates from the most recent national survey are used as the national estimate, since the survey estimates derived from a birth history are retrospective and typically refer to a period before the year of the survey, which may be several years behind the target year for the UN IGME estimates. National estimates may also use a different combination of data sources, or different projection or calculation methods.
In the absence of error-free data, there will always be uncertainty around data and estimates. To allow for added comparability, the UN IGME generates estimates with uncertainty bounds. When discussing the UN IGME estimates, it’s important to look at the uncertainty ranges, which might be fairly wide in the case of some countries."
Data collection process,"For under-five mortality, UNICEF and the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) compile data from all available data sources, including household surveys, censuses, and vital registration data. UNICEF and the UN IGME compile these data whenever they are available publicly and then conduct data quality assessment. UNICEF also collects data through UNICEF country offices by reaching national counterpart(s). The UN IGME also collects vital registration data reported by Ministries of Health or other relevant agencies to WHO."
Preferred data sources,"Civil registration with complete coverage is the preferred data source for under-five, infant and neonatal mortality estimation. The calculation of the under-five and infant mortality rates from civil registration data is derived from a standard period abridged life table using available data on the number of deaths and mid-year populations. For civil registration data), initially annual observations were constructed for all observation years in a country."
Other data sources,"Household surveys and population census.
Most survey data come in one of two forms: the full birth history (FBH), whereby women are asked for the date of birth of each of their children, whether the child is still alive, and if not, the age at death; and the summary birth history (SBH), whereby women are asked only about the number of their children ever born and the number that have died (or equivalently the number still alive)."

Data providers,The National Statistical Office or the Ministry of Health is the typical provider of data for generating under-five mortality estimates at the national level.
