SDG Goal,3.9.1 – Household and ambient air pollution
Short description,"Burden of disease attributable to joint effects of household and ambient air pollution.
(SDG 3.9.1)"
Definition,"The burden of disease attributable to joint effects of household and ambient air pollution can be expressed as: death rate (both crude and age-standardized).
- Death rates are calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the total population.
- Age-standardized rates adjust for differences in population age distribution by applying the observed age-specific mortality rates for each population to a standard population. The age-standardized rates can therefore be used to compare the rates of countries without being affected by the differences in age distribution from country to country.
Evidence from epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to air pollution is linked, among others, to the important diseases taken into account in this estimate: 1) Lower respiratory infections in general population; 2) Stroke in adults (25 years and over); 3) Ischaemic heart diseases in adults (25 years and over); 4) Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases in adults (25 years and over); and 5) Trachea, bronchus and lung cancers in adults (25 years and over)."

Method of estimation aggregates,"For death rates, the country deaths are summed according to the region of interest and divided by the corresponding regional population."
Rationale,"As part of a broader project to assess major risk factors to health, the burden of disease resulting from both, exposure to ambient (outdoor) air pollution and household (indoor) air pollution from polluting fuel use for cooking, was assessed. Ambient air pollution results from emissions from industrial activity, households, cars and trucks which are complex mixtures of air pollutants, many of which are harmful to health. Of all of these pollutants, fine particulate matter has the greatest effect on human health. By polluting fuels is understood solid fuels such as wood, coal, animal dung, charcoal, and crop wastes and also kerosene. The majority of the burden due to household air pollution is borne by the populations in low and middle-income countries.In high-income countries, urban outdoor air pollution ranks in the top ten risk factors to health, and is the first environmental risk factor."
Denominator,"An approximation of the combined effects of risk factors is possible if independence and little correlation between risk factors with impacts on the same diseases can be assumed (Ezzati et al 2003). In the case of air pollution, however, there are some limitations to estimate the joint effects: limited knowledge on the distribution of the population exposed to both household and ambient air pollution, correlation of exposures at individual level as household air pollution is a contributor to ambient air pollution, and non-linear interactions. In several regions, however, household air pollution remains mainly a rural issue, while ambient air pollution is predominantly an urban problem. Also, in some continents, many countries are relatively unaffected by household air pollution, while ambient air pollution is a major concern. If assuming independence and little correlation, a rough estimate of the total impact can be calculated, which is less than the sum of the impact of the two risk factors. The joint effects of both ambient and household air pollution would result in the impacts shown in the present table. Given the limitations, however, the estimates presented should be interpreted with caution, and provide indicative values only."

Preferred data sources,"Exposure: Indicator 7.1.2 was used as exposure indicator for household air pollution.
Annual mean concentration of particulate matter of less than 2.5 um was used as exposure indicator for ambient air pollution. The data is modelled according to methods described for Indicator 11.6.2.
Exposure-risk function: The integrated exposure-response functions (IER) developed for the GBD 2010 and 2013 (Burnett et al, 2014 and Forouzanfar et al, 2015) were used. These IERs were updated using the most recent epidemiological evidence identified through a systematic search of studies on particulate matter and mortality for the five outcomes of interest.
Health data: The total number of deaths by disease, country, sex and age group have been developed by the World Health Organization (WHO 2019b)."
