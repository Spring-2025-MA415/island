Method of measurement,Survey estimates are based on standardized methodology using the WHO Child Growth Standards as described elsewhere (Ref: Anthro software manual). Global and regional estimates are based on methodology outlined in UNICEF-WHO-The World Bank: Joint child malnutrition estimates - Levels and trends (UNICEF/WHO/WB 2021 edition).
Method of estimation aggregates,"Method of estimation of global and regional aggregates: Regional aggregates are available for the following classifications: UN, MDG, UNICEF, WHO, The World Bank regions and income groups"
Process of validation,"UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank undertake a joint review for each potential primary data source used as to generate the JME global estimates. The group conducts a review when (at minimum) a final report with full methodological details and results are available, as well as (ideally) a data quality assessment flagging potential limitations. When the raw data are available, they are analysed using the Anthro Survey Analyzer software to produce a standard set of results and data quality outputs against which the review is conducted (UNICEF-WHO-World Bank 2020). Comments are documented in a standard review template extracting methodological details (e.g., sampling procedures, description of anthropometrical equipment), data quality outputs (e.g., weight and height distributions, percentage of cases that were flagged as implausible according to the WHO Child Growth Standards) and the malnutrition prevalence estimates from the data source under review generated based on the standard recommended methodology. These estimates are compared against the reported values, as well as against those from other data sources already included in the JME dataset, to assess the plausibility of the trend before including the new point. Reports that are preliminary, or that lack key details on methodology or results, cannot be reviewed and are left pending until full information is available.
The methods used to generate the JME global estimates for stunting and overweight were cross validated to ensure estimates produced by the method are closely aligned to national data points. It was also reviewed through a technical consultation with experts and country representatives of National Statistics Offices as well as IAEG-SDGs Members in 2019 (UNICEF/WHO/World Bank, 2019). Country consultations with SDG 2.2 focal points were also held in 2020/2021 before finalizing and disseminating the JME global estimates for the in 2021 edition of the JME. The purpose of the country consultations was to explain the updated methodology for overweight estimates to national governments; to ensure the estimates included all recent and relevant primary data sources; and to engage with and receive feedback from national governments on the estimates."
Denominator,"Survey estimates come with levels of uncertainty due to both sampling error and non-sampling error (e.g., measurement technical error, recording error etc.,). The JME global estimates for stunting take into account estimates of sampling error around survey estimates. While non-sampling error cannot be accounted for or reviewed in full, when available, a data quality review of weight, height and age measurements from household surveys supports compilation of a time series that is comparable across countries and over time."
Institutional mandate,"WHO has an established role in the monitoring of child growth and malnutrition since the late 1980’s, and had the mandate to developed the WHO Child Growth Standards, launched in 2006, and adopted by more than 160 countries. WHO has published several peer-reviewed articles with regional and global estimates until 2012, when they joined forces with UNICEF and the World Bank, with the objective of harmonizing child malnutrition estimates. WHO has the mandate to monitor and report progress on the six global nutrition targets, endorsed in 2012 by the World Health Assembly, amongst them, three on child malnutrition, namely stunting, wasting and overweight (SDG 2.2.1, 2.2.2a and 2.2.b)."
Associated resolutions,WHA65.6
Notes,"The WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study (MGRS) (WHO 2006) was undertaken to generate a growth standard for assessing the growth and development of infants and young children around the world. The MGRS collected primary growth data and related information from children from widely different ethnic backgrounds and cultural settings (Brazil, Ghana, India, Norway, Oman, and the USA). The resulting growth standard can be applied to all children everywhere, regardless of ethnicity, socioeconomic status and type of feeding."
Data collection process,"WHO data gathering strongly relies on the organization’s structure and network established over the past 30 years, since the creation of its global database, the WHO Global Database on Child Growth and Malnutrition"
Preferred data sources,"For the majority of countries, nationally representative household surveys constitute the primary data source used to generate the JME global estimates. For a limited number of countries data from surveillance systems are also used as a primary data source for generation of the JME global estimates if sufficient population coverage is documented (about 80%). For both types of primary data sources, theLast updated: 2022-11-22child’s length/height and weight measurements have to be collected following recommended standard measuring techniques."
Expected frequency of data collection,Data sources are updated in a continuous base to feed into the annual production of global and regional estimates and updated country level dataset released every March
Data providers,"Majority of the data sources used are nationally representative household surveys e.g., Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) and National Nutrition Surveys (NNS). Data providers vary and most commonly are ministries of health, national offices of statistics or national institutes of nutrition."
