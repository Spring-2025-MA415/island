Method of measurement,"The serosurvey sample should be drawn from the specific geographic region to be verified. For example if the purpose is to estimate national childhood hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission (including mother-to-child transmission) then the sampling should be geographically representative of the population. Convenience sampling is not appropriate. The sample size should be adequate to show with 95% confidence HBsAg prevalence of less than 1% with a precision of ± 0.5%. The target age is 5-years-old. Sampling 4–6 year olds may be appropriate. The serosurvey is cross sectional and therefore a point estimate time. The shorter time periods of data collection are therefore preferred. Data on HepB birth dose exposure and HepB3 completion should be drawn from official records. Where these are not available testing for HBsAb may be considered for the serosurvey. This is less preferable as it is more costly, but can also be done in addition. Specimen collection and transportation should be appropriate to minimize bias though specimen degradation in rural and remote areas. Where possible, it is advantageous to collect blood specimens for ELISA laboratory testing because the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) is higher than for rapid tests. However in some locations only rapid tests will be available hence test selection is resource dependent. This should be considered in designing overall study methodology. When an appropriate sampling strategy and size are used and quality testing assays and laboratory procedures are employed, the HBsAg prevalence in the serosurvey should be representative of the incidence of childhood HBV transmission in the specific geographic region (or country) in this age group."
Process of validation,"WHO provides Member States the opportunity to review and comment on data as part of the so called country consultation process. Member States receive an annex with their country specific estimates, the serosurveys used to inform the mathematical model and the summary of the methodology. They are provided with sufficient time to provide any additional study to be screened according to the inclusion and inclusion criteria."
Rationale,"The purpose is to describe the reduction in chronic hepatitis b infections. Most of the burden of disease from HBV infection comes from infections acquired before the age of 5 years. Therefore, prevention of HBV infection focuses on children under 5 years of age. The United Nations selected the cumulative incidence of chronic HBV infection at 5 years of age as an indicator of the Sustainable Development Goal target for “combating hepatitis”. This indicator is measured indirectly through the proportion of children 5 years of age who have developed chronic HBV infection (i.e. the proportion that tests positive for a marker of infection called hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg])."
Denominator,"The main Limitations of the analysis is that despite the thorough and in-depth literature search and access, there are fewer data on post vaccination studies than pre- vaccination studies. The model is largely informed by pre-vaccination studies in adults.
The quality of studies and data was assessed by reviewing representativeness of sampling. Bias factor is a dichotomous variable.
Potential important biases included geographical representation of the data points. Also, studies were from many different sources such as blood donors and pregnant women. The former possibly having a lower proportion of Hep B prevalence than the general population as donor questionnaires often exclude individuals with risk factors for blood-borne diseases and the pregnant women possibly having a higher prevalence as were in studies to see the effect of a birth dose of vaccine to prevent vertical transmission. As the proportion of studies and size of studies that were from blood donors was significantly greater than those on pregnant women, we may presume that our estimates of prevalence of pre- vaccination may be on the low side."
Comments,Estimates are provided for the 194 WHO Member States and grouped accordingly to the six WHO regions. We also provide estimates according to income classification and follow UN Regional Groupings and Compositions as much as possible.
Notes,"It is not possible, on clinical grounds, to differentiate hepatitis B from hepatitis caused by other viral agents, hence, laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis is essential. The Hepatitis B surface antigen is the most common hepatitis B test. The presence of HBsAg in serum indicates that the patient has contracted HBV infection. The measurement of HBsAg levels have been standardized in IU/ml. The test is used to identify those at risk of spreading the disease. HBsAg, an HBV viral coat antigen, is produced in large quantities in infected-cell cytoplasm and continues to be produced in patients with chronic, active HBV infection. Documented HBsAg positivity in serum for 6 or more months suggests chronic HBV with a low likelihood of subsequent spontaneous resolution."
Data collection process,"A systematic search on articles published between Jan 1, 1965, and Oct 30, 2018. in the databases Embase, PubMed, Global Index Medicus, Popline, and Web of Science.
Following full text review, we extracted data from each study using the following variables: study characteristics (study and sample collection dates, study locations i.e., city, subnational [an area, region, state, or province in a country], or national level), participant characteristics (age range, sex, year, and population group), and prevalence of the HBV marker, type of laboratory tests, and number of participants the HBV marker prevalence was based on.
Data of eligible articles were entered into a Microsoft EXCEL® and/or Distiller databank by two reviewers independently. Information was extracted for author name, year, age, gender, marker, laboratory test used, number of individuals tested, prevalence of each marker when reported, the population group (general population, HCWs, or blood donors) and whether the data reported was for a city, sub-national (an area, region, state or province in a country) or national level, GDP per capita. In addition to HBsAg, HBeAg was recorded, as available for individuals when HBsAg was also reported. In order to record information on methodological quality and study bias resulting from non-representativeness, an additional variable was used: samples likely to be representative for the country/area specified were coded as 0 and others, e.g. convenience samples in certain communities or tribes in the country were assigned a 1, supplemented by additional information. The risk of bias/non-representativeness information was applied if the population was neither HCW nor blood donor."
Preferred data sources,Eligible studies
Other data sources,"Additional data from other sources than the eligible studies:
1. Year of vaccine introduction in the entire country: data is derived from official reports by WHO Member States and unless otherwise stated, data is reported annually through the WHO/UNICEF joint reporting process.
2. Period when the study was conducted: pre- vaccination or post vaccination. This is determined according the year of introduction in the whole country.
3. Coverage estimates series: data is obtained from WUENIC: http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/timeseries/tswucoveragebcg.html
4. GDP per capita was used form UN data that compiles information from the World Bank Source http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?q=GDP&d=SNAAMA&f=grID%3a101%3bcurrID%3aUSD%3bpcFlag%3a1 ),
5. Longitude and latitude data (source: www.google.com).
6. Population structure and size data for each country was from the UN population division"
Expected frequency of data collection,The systematic review of published serosurveys and model estimates are updated on an annual basis.
