SDG Goal,11.6.2 - Fine particulate matter
Short description,Mean annual concentration of fine suspended particles of less than 2.5 microns in diameter.
Definition,The mean annual concentration of fine suspended particles of less than 2.5 microns in diameters is a common measure of air pollution. The mean is a population-weighted average for urban population in a country.
Direction of progress,Figures decreasing over time demonstrate progress through the reduction of air pollution.

Method of measurement,"Concentration of PM2.5 are regularly measured from fixed-site,  population-oriented monitors located within the metropolitan areas. High-quality measurements of PM concentration from all the monitors in the metropolitan area can be averaged to develop a single estimate."
Method of estimation aggregates,"The regional and global aggregates are population-weighted figures of the national estimates.
Although PM is measured at many thousands of locations throughout the world, the amount of monitors in different geographical areas vary, with some areas having little or no monitoring. In order to produce global estimates at high resolution (0.1◦ grid‐cells), additional data is required."
Process of validation,"Draft estimates are reviewed with Member States through a WHO country consultation process and SDG focal points every time new data are generated. In addition, the methods and data are published in a peer-reviewed journal."
Rationale,"Air pollution consists of many pollutants, among other particulate matter. These particles are able to penetrate deeply into the respiratory tract and therefore constitute a risk for health by increasing mortality from respiratory infections and diseases, lung cancer, and selected cardiovascular diseases."
Denominator,"While the data quality available for urban/rural population is generally good for high-income countries, it can be relatively poor for some low- and middle income areas. Furthermore, the definition of urban/rural may greatly vary by country."
Institutional mandate,"The World Health Organization (WHO) is the Custodian Agency or co-Custodian Agency for reporting on several SDG indicators, including indicator 11.6.2, annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (e.g. PM2.5 and PM10) in cities (population weighted))."
Notes,"The PM2.5 concentrations are geographically classified according to the 2021 United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) Degree of Urbanization classification: cities, towns and rural areas. Data is also provided for urban (aggregation of cities and towns) and all (aggregation of cities, towns and rural) areas."
Data collection process,"Data collection process for ground measurements include official reporting from countries to WHO (after request), and web searches. Measurements of PM10 or PM2.5 from official national/sub-national reports and websites or reported by regional networks such as Clean Air Asia for Asia and the European Environment Agency for Europe or data from UN agencies, development agencies, articles from peer reviewed journals and ground measurements are compiled in the framework of the Global Burden of Disease Project."
Preferred data sources,"Sources of data include ground measurements from monitoring networks, collected for 6,000 cities and localities (WHO, 2022) around the world, satellite remote sensing, population estimates, topography, information on local monitoring networks and measures of specific contributors of air pollution (WHO, 2022)."
