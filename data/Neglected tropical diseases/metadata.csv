Method of estimation aggregates,"Global and regional estimates are simple aggregates of the country values, with no particular weighting. There is no further adjustment for global and regional estimates."
Process of validation,"Data is jointly validated by the three levels of the organization – countries, regions and global."
Rationale,"The average annual number of people requiring treatment and care for NTDs is the number that is expected to decrease toward “the end of NTDs” by 2030 (target 3.3), as NTDs are eradicated, eliminated or controlled. The number of people requiring other interventions against NTDs (e.g. vector management, veterinary public health, water, sanitation and hygiene) are expected to need to be maintained beyond 2030 and are therefore to be addressed in the context of other targets and indicators, namely Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and universal access to water and sanitation. This number should not be interpreted as the number of people at risk for NTDs. It is in fact a subset of the larger number of people at risk. Mass treatment is limited to those living in districts above a threshold level of prevalence; it does not include all people living in districts with any risk of infection. Individual treatment and care is for those who are or have already been infected; it does not include all contacts and others at risk of infection. This number can better be interpreted as the number of people at a level of risk requiring medical intervention – that is, treatment and care for NTDs."
Denominator,Country reports may not be perfectly comparable over time. Improved surveillance and case-finding may lead to an apparent increase in the number of people known to require treatment and care. Some further estimation may be required to adjust for changes in surveillance and case-finding. Missing country reports may need to be imputed for some diseases in some years.
Institutional mandate,A process of data reporting by national NTD programmes implemented according to the WHO Data Sharing Policy on use and sharing of data collected in Member States by the World Health Organization (WHO) outside the context of public health emergencies. The department of control of Neglected tropical diseases at WHO is then responsible for processing and disseminating the statistics for this indicator.
Comments,Country reports may not be perfectly comparable over time. Improved surveillance and case-finding may lead to an apparent increase in the number of people known to require treatment and care. Some further estimation may be required to adjust for changes in surveillance and case-finding. Missing country reports may need to be imputed for some diseases in some years.
Notes,"Other key interventions against NTDs (e.g. vector management, veterinary public health, water, sanitation and hygiene) are to be addressed in the context of other targets and indicators, namely Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and universal access to water and sanitation."
Data collection process,"As part of global efforts to accelerate expansion of preventive chemotherapy for elimination and control of lymphatic filariasis (LF), schistosomiasis (SCH) and soil-transmitted helminthiases (STH), WHO facilitates the supply of the following medicines donated by the pharmaceutical industry: diethylcarbamazine citrate, albendazole, mebendazole, and praziquantel. WHO also collaborates to supply ivermectin for onchocerciasis (ONCHO) and LF elimination programmes, and azithromycin for trachoma (TRA) through the Trachoma Elimination Monitoring Form.
A joint mechanism and a set of forms have been developed to facilitate the process of application, review and reporting as well as to improve coordination and integration among different programmes.
Joint Request for Selected PC Medicines (JRSM) – designed to assist countries in quantifying the number of tablets of the relevant medicines required to reach the planned target population and districts in a coordinated and integrated manner against multiple diseases during the year for which medicines are requested.
Joint Reporting Form (JRF) – designed to assist countries in reporting annual progress on integrated and coordinated distribution of medicines across PC-NTDs in the reporting year in a standardized format.
PC Epidemiological Data Reporting Form (EPIRF) – designed to standardize national reporting of epidemiological data on LF, ONCHO, soil-transmitted helminthiases and SCH. National authorities are encouraged to complete this form and submit it to WHO on a yearly basis, together with the JRF.
The reports generated in the JRSM and in the JRF (SUMMARY worksheets) must be printed and signed by the NTD coordinator or a Ministry of Health representative to formally endorse the country’s request for these medicines and the reported annual progress of the national programme(s). The date of signature must also be included. Once signatures have been obtained, the scanned copies of the two worksheets, together with the full Excel versions of the JRSM, the JRF and the EPIRF can be jointly submitted to WHO.
The forms are submitted to the WHO Representative of the concerned WHO Country office with electronic copies and the concerned Regional focal point. The relevant submission deadline depends on the time of planned implementation dates as follows: • the final report should be submitted within 3 months after the last round was implemented and no later than 31 March of the next implementation year; • to ensure the medicines are delivered on time, the request for PC medicines should be submitted at least 9 months before the first date of MDA planned in the calendar year of the request.
For NTDs requiring individual diagnosis and treatment, countries are invited to report on Buruli ulcer, Chagas disease, leprosy, the leishmaniases, mycetoma, rabies, snakebite envenoming and yaws cases using Excel templates or directly into the WHO integrated data platform (https://extranet.who.int/dhis2). Modules are under development to collect information on, echinococcosis and taeniasis cases through the same platform.
Cases of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) and other key HAT indicators are reported at village level by national sleeping sickness control programmes through annual reports and entered in the Atlas of HAT (https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/1476-072X-8-15), but annual cases aggregated at country level are also entered in the WHO integrated data platform."
Preferred data sources,"The number of people requiring treatment and care for NTDs is measured by existing country systems, and reported through joint request and reporting forms for donated medicines, the WHO Integrated Data Platform, and other reports to WHO."
Expected frequency of data collection,Data for the reporting year is being collected and reported during first 3 quarters of the next year.
