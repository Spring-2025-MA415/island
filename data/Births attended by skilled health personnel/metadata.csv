Short description,"Proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel.
(SDG 3.1.2)"
Definition,"Proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel (generally doctors, nurses or midwives but can refer to other health professionals providing childbirth care) is the proportion of childbirths attended by professional health personnel.
According to the current definition (1) these are competent maternal and newborn health (MNH) professionals educated, trained and regulated to national and international standards. They are competent to: (i) provide and promote evidence-based, human-rights based, quality, socio-culturally sensitive and dignified care to women and newborns; (ii) facilitate physiological processes during labour and delivery to ensure a clean and positive childbirth experience; and (iii) identify and manage or refer women and/or newborns with complications."

Method of measurement,"The percentage of births attended by skilled health personnel is calculated as the number of births attended by skilled health personnel (doctor, nurse and/or midwife) expressed as total number of life births in the same period. Births attended by skilled health personnel = (Number of births attended by skilled health personnel / Total number of live births) x 100. In household surveys, such as the Demographic and Health Surveys, the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, and the Reproductive Health Surveys, the respondent is asked about each live birth and who had helped them during childbirth for a period up to five years (or three years) before the interview. Service/facility records could be used where a high proportion of births occur in health facilities"
Numerator,"Number of births attended by skilled health personnel (doctor, nurse or midwife) trained in providing quality obstetric care, including giving the necessary support and care to the mother and the newborn during childbirth and immediate postpartum period."
Denominator,The total number of live births in the same period
Method of estimation aggregates,"Regional and global estimates are calculated using weighed averages. Annual number of births from United Nations Population Division, World Population Prospects are used as weighing indicator. Regional values are calculated for a reference year, including a range of four to five years for each reference year or year range. For example, for 2021, the latest year available for the period 2015-2021 was used."
Process of validation,"As part of the data harmonization process, an annual country consultation is conducted by UNICEF. Country inputs are reviewed and assessed jointly with WHO. During the process, SDG country focal points are contacted for updating and verifying values included in the database and obtaining new sources of data. The national categories of skilled health personnel are verified, and the estimates for some countries may include additional categories of trained personnel beyond doctor, nurse, and midwife. This process serves as validation of the reported values. Furthermore, with regard to data obtained from surveys, the validity of such data depends on the correct identification by the women of the credentials of the person attending the childbirth, which may not be obvious in certain countries."
Rationale,Having a skilled health care provider at the time of childbirth is an important lifesaving intervention for both women and newborns. Not having access to this key assistance is detrimental to women's and newborns’ health because it could cause the death of the women and/or the newborns or long lasting morbidity. Achieving universal coverage for this indicator is therefore essential for reducing maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity.
Denominator,"Births attended by skilled health personnel is an indicator of health care utilization. It is a measure of the health system’s functioning and potential to provide adequate coverage for childbirth. On its own, however, this indicator does not provide insight into the availability or accessibility of services, for example in cases where emergency care is needed. Neither does this indicator capture the quality of care received.
Data collection and data interpretation in many countries is challenged by lack of guidelines, standardization of professional titles and functions of the health care provider, and in some countries by task-shifting. In addition, many countries have found that there are large gaps between international standards and the competencies of existing health care professionals providing childbirth care. Lack of training and an enabling environment often hinder evidence-based management of common obstetric and neonatal complications."
Comments,"An important aspect of this indicator is the reporting of categories or occupational titles of health providers at country level. Standard categories for the indicator include doctor, nurse and midwife. However, some additional categories are currently being reported by some countries. When that is the case, a process of verification is conducted in which the competency level of other categories of health care providers is assessed with national sources and in communication with national counterparts."
Data collection process,"UNICEF and WHO maintain a joint database on SDG 3.1.2: “Proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel” and collaborate to ensure quality and consistency of data sources.
As part of the data harmonization process and interaction with countries, an annual country consultation is conducted by UNICEF. During the country consultation, SDG country focal points are contacted for updating and verifying values included in the database and for obtaining new data sources. New data sources are reviewed and assessed jointly with WHO. As part of the process, the national categories or occupational titles of skilled health personnel are verified. The reported data for some countries may include additional categories of trained personnel beyond doctor, nurse and midwife."
Preferred data sources,"National-level household surveys are the main data sources used to collect data for skilled health personnel providing childbirth care. These surveys include Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS) and other national surveys based on similar methodologies. In these surveys the respondent is asked about the last live birth and who helped during delivery for a period up to five years before the interview. Surveys are undertaken every three to five years.
Population-based surveys are the preferred data source in countries with a low utilization of childbirth services, where private sector data are excluded from routine data collection, and/or with weak health information systems."
Other data sources,Routine service/facility records are a more common data source in countries where a high proportion of births occur in health facilities and are therefore recorded. These data can be used to track the indicator on an annual basis.
