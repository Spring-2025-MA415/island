# Island Project
This repository contains the data I collected for a specific island, Barbados.

I found the shapefile here: https://simplemaps.com/gis/country/bb.

I found all health information regarding Barbados on the WHO website: https://data.who.int/countries/052.
All of this data is found in the folder `data` with a data dictionary available that is applicable to all datasets.
